Prevent common situations (mainly when working on a dev team):
- Dev sometimes includes open wide version ranges on package.json, that later will be installed a most recent on your build/production environment and break your project
- Some devs on team uses npm to install packages while others uses yarn, causing a lock file inconsistency, probably breaking your build/production environment with messages like "Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn"
- Versions being updated on package.json file, without calling a `yarn` or `npm install` after that, to replicate that version to lock file 

**Default rules:**
- Disallow to have a versions range (ex: ^1.0.4 or 1.0.x) other than specific version (ex: 1.0.4) on package dependencies
- Disallow to have package-lock.json and yarn.lock at same time
- Disallow to have different hashed versions on package.json and yarn.lock file

Other rules could be added, suggest it on the [issues](https://github.com/tiagoGouvea/package-locks-checks/issues).

## Installation

Install globally:

```sh
yarn global add package-locks-checks
```

or 

```sh
npm install -g package-locks-checks 
```

Or run with npx:

```sh
npx package-locks-checks
```

## Usage

To force check with all default validator just run

```sh
package-locks-checks
```

This will validate all rules and return success if everything is ok.

. . .

To check on a different folder you can run

```sh
package-locks-checks --basePath './api'
```

## Options:

```text
Param                                     Default  Description
-p, --basePath <path>                              Base path to load package files
-f, --packageFile <filename>                       Full path to package.json file
-r, --allowRange <boolean>                false    Allow to have a range (ex: 1 or 1.x or ^1.0.4) other than specific version (ex: 1.0 or 1.0.4) on package dependencies
-mlf, --allowMultipleLockFiles <boolean>  false    Allow to have package-lock.json and yarn.lock at same time', false)
-uyl, --allowUnmatchedYarnLock <boolean>  false    Allow to have different hashed versions on package.json and yarn.lock file', false)
```


## Exit codes

```text
0 = No errors
1 = Errors were founds in the package-lock.json files
2 = Folder or package.json was not found
```


## To be implemented

- Detect "prefered" package manager, to validate npm issues as well
- Validate package-lock.json with package.lock versions
- Use [hasLockfile](https://github.com/luftywiranda13/has-lockfile) to validate multiple lock files
- Auto publish package on npm when merging do main
- Update exit codes with 2 other than 1 when folder missing
